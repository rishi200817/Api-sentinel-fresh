# API Sentinel — iQOO Hackathon Edition

> **Your API changed. Your documentation shouldn't fall behind.**

API Sentinel is **API change intelligence + contract drift detection + breaking-change
analysis + AI engineering assistance + safe documentation synchronization**. It watches
backend source code, detects API contract changes, explains their impact, updates OpenAPI
safely, validates the result, publishes live docs — and keeps developers in the loop from
their **phone**.

```
Developer changes code → GitHub push/webhook → Sentinel detects change → source analysis
→ deterministic diff → breaking-risk → impact → AI explanation → OpenAPI patch
→ validation → live docs → phone notification → ask/approve from anywhere
```

**No faked functionality.** Every button performs its action, every number is computed
from backend state, and every capability the environment can't provide is labeled
honestly with a working fallback.

The **deterministic engine is the source of truth** and is independently testable.
AI explains; it never decides facts.

## How detection works

1. **Change detection** — GitHub `push` webhook (HMAC-verified, deduplicated) or manual
   "Analyze now". The compare API identifies changed files; first scans and rescans use
   a full tarball snapshot.
2. **Safe scan** — `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, lockfiles, binaries, huge files are
   skipped with reasons. Tests/docs/examples are searched as *consumers only*, never
   treated as the contract. Repository code is **never executed** — static analysis only.
3. **Framework detection** — scored signals with explicit confidence; below threshold
   the UI shows `Unknown` with the reason.
4. **Route extraction** — per-framework parsers resolve mounts/prefixes, parameters,
   request/response shapes, and auth evidence into the normalized contract.
5. **Incremental parse** — per-file SHA cache: only changed files are re-scanned;
   assembly re-runs over merged models so cross-file mounts stay exact.
6. **Diff + risk** — field-level diffing, deterministic severity (`LOW→CRITICAL`) and
   verdicts (`non-breaking → likely-breaking`), never more certain than the evidence.
7. **Impact** — consumer search with tiers: verified reference, likely consumer,
   reference found, potentially affected.
8. **AI** — grounded summary/explanation from the analysis context.
9. **OpenAPI** — minimal patch of the repo's own spec (or last published, or fresh
   skeleton), dual-engine validation, publish **only if valid**.
10. **Notify + audit** — in-app notifications, optional browser alerts, full history.

## Supported frameworks

- **Express / Node.js** — `app`/`router` verbs, nested routers, mount prefixes,
  `:params`, middleware auth hints, `req.body`/`req.query`/`res.status` inference.
- **FastAPI / Python** — decorators, `APIRouter` + `include_router` prefixes,
  `Query`/`Body`/`Path`, Pydantic models (incl. inheritance), `response_model`,
  status codes, `Depends` auth.
- **Spring Boot / Java** — `@RestController`, class/method mappings,
  `@PathVariable`/`@RequestParam`/`@RequestBody`, DTOs (class + record),
  `ResponseEntity`, `@PreAuthorize`/`@Secured`/`@RolesAllowed`.

Unsupported constructs are **marked explicitly** (e.g. multi-path mappings,
reactive return types) instead of producing wrong routes.

## API contract model

Every endpoint normalizes to `EndpointContract`: `method`, `path` (OpenAPI style),
`controller`, `sourceFile`, `sourceLine`, `pathParams`, `queryParams`, `requestBody`,
`responses`, `auth`, `summary`, `description`, `confidence` — each fact carrying its
`origin` (`detected` vs `inferred`).

## Diff engine

Change types: `NEW_ENDPOINT`, `DELETED_ENDPOINT`, `MODIFIED_ENDPOINT`,
`REQUEST_SCHEMA_CHANGED`, `RESPONSE_SCHEMA_CHANGED`, `PARAMETER_CHANGED`,
`METHOD_CHANGED`, `AUTH_CHANGED`, `NO_CHANGE` — with granular field events
(added/removed/type-changed/required-changed/param/status/auth/method).

## Breaking-change logic

Deterministic matrix (see `src/lib/sentinel/impact/risk.ts`): new endpoints and
optional additions are low risk; required additions are potentially breaking;
removals, type changes, method changes, deletions, and auth removal escalate to
high/critical. Auth removal always demands mandatory review.

## AI architecture

Provider abstraction with honest status:

1. **Local / open-source** (`LocalAIProvider`) — Ollama-compatible runtime.
2. **Remote dev fallback** (`RemoteAIProvider`) — OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
3. **Deterministic grounded fallback** — template answers computed from real data.

Priority is local → remote → deterministic (configurable). The UI always shows which
provider answered. Repository content is wrapped as **untrusted data**; system
instructions outrank it (prompt-injection defense), and secrets are never revealed.

## Local AI architecture

`src/lib/local-ai/transport.ts` speaks the Ollama chat API (`/api/tags` probe,
`/api/chat` completion, `images[]` for vision models). No fictional NPU SDKs: if the
runtime is unreachable the UI shows **LOCAL MODEL: NOT CONNECTED** and falls back
deterministically. Point `SENTINEL_LOCAL_AI_URL` at any Ollama-compatible server
(phone, laptop bridge, or event-provided runtime) to go live.

## GitHub webhook setup

1. Deploy Sentinel and set a webhook secret (Settings → GitHub, or
   `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`).
2. In GitHub → repository → Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook:
   - Payload URL: `https://<your-host>/api/webhooks/github`
   - Content type: `application/json`
   - Secret: the same value
   - Events: **Just the push event**
3. Push to the monitored branch. Deliveries appear in
   Repositories → webhook table with accept/reject/duplicate state.

Manual **Analyze now** and full rescans remain available alongside monitoring.

## OpenAPI generation

The writer **patches minimally**: it upserts only synced operations and preserves
`info`, `servers`, `tags`, security schemes, examples, and unrelated paths. Deletions
require explicit approval (`allowDelete`). Selective sync (`Sync this change`,
`Sync selected`) and policy-driven auto-sync (`manual` / `auto-safe` / `auto-all`)
are all supported.

## Validation

Two engines, both must pass:

1. Custom Sentinel structural checks (versions, required blocks, path-param
   consistency, duplicates, strict-mode summaries).
2. `@apidevtools/swagger-parser` (standards-compliant dereference + schema check).

Invalid specs are **rejected with exact errors** — nothing invalid is ever published.

## Swagger / Redoc

- `/docs/swagger?repo=<id>` — Swagger UI **bundled locally**, fed the live spec.
- `/docs/redoc?repo=<id>` — Redoc via CDN with an automatic **offline fallback**
  explorer rendering the same live data if the CDN is unreachable.

## Mobile experience

`/mobile` is a first-class surface: repository status, health ring, breaking-alert
hero, changes feed with one-tap sync, grounded Ask with **voice input**
(Web Speech API, graceful fallback) and read-aloud answers, live docs, approvals,
and notification opt-in. Bottom navigation: Home · Changes · Ask · Docs · More.

## Phone workflow

- **Laptop**: connect GitHub, deep analysis, OpenAPI review, Swagger, publishing.
- **Phone**: monitor, receive alerts, ask by voice, review diffs, approve/reject.
- State is server-side: an approval on the phone instantly reflects on the laptop.

## Office Kit workflow

Sentinel is web-native: open the same deployment on laptop + phone and both stay in
sync. The Phone Console (`/dashboard/phone`) provides share/copy handoff for live
URLs. **No proprietary pairing is faked** — pairing status reads *not detected*
until a real bridge exists; if the event provides an Office Kit bridge, it carries
these same live URLs.

## Camera ("Scan API")

`/mobile/scan` captures a real photo (camera or upload), downscales it on-device,
and sends it to the agent **only when you tap Analyze**. With a vision-capable
local model (e.g. LLaVA via Ollama) or remote vision provider configured, Sentinel
transcribes visible API content and cross-checks it against the live spec.
Otherwise it says plainly that vision is unavailable — never a fake analysis.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SENTINEL_DATA_DIR` | Persistent store directory (default `./data`) |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GH_TOKEN` | GitHub API token (private repos, rate limits) |
| `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook HMAC secret (all deliveries rejected without it) |
| `SENTINEL_LOCAL_AI_URL` | Local runtime base URL (default `http://localhost:11434`) |
| `SENTINEL_LOCAL_AI_MODEL` | Local model name (default `llama3.1`) |
| `SENTINEL_REMOTE_AI_URL` | Remote OpenAI-compatible base URL (optional) |
| `SENTINEL_REMOTE_AI_KEY` | Remote API key (optional) |
| `SENTINEL_REMOTE_AI_MODEL` | Remote model (default `gpt-4o-mini`) |
| `SENTINEL_AI_PROVIDER` | `auto`/`local`/`remote`/`deterministic` |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | GitHub OAuth login (optional; UI shows “not configured” without them) |

Settings UI mirrors these; secrets are write-only (set/not-set shown, values never
returned).

## Authentication

Two providers, one session system:

- **Email + password** (`/signup`, `/login`) — passwords are salted scrypt
  hashes (never stored or logged in plain text); login failures take the same
  time whether or not the email exists, so accounts can't be enumerated.
- **GitHub OAuth** (“Continue with GitHub”) — standard authorization-code flow
  with single-use, 10-minute `state`. Accounts link automatically when GitHub
  confirms a verified email match; otherwise the login stops with a clear
  message instead of merging accounts.

Sessions are opaque 256-bit tokens in an `httpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` cookie
(`Secure` on https); only the token's sha256 is stored, sessions expire after
30 days, and login/signup are rate-limited per IP. Viewing (dashboards, docs,
Ask) stays public; **writes require login** — connecting/editing repos, running
analyses, approvals, doc syncs, settings, notifications, and demo actions.
The GitHub webhook stays public by necessity and is protected by its HMAC
signature instead. Authenticated actions record your email as the audit actor.

To enable GitHub login: create an OAuth App at
github.com → Settings → Developer settings (callback URL
`<your-origin>/api/auth/github/callback`, e.g.
`http://localhost:3000/api/auth/github/callback`), then set
`GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` and restart.

## Local setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
npm run seed       # optional: register demos + run baselines
```

Open `/demo` for the guided script, `/mobile` for the phone experience.

## Database setup

No external database required. The embedded store (`SENTINEL_DATA_DIR/sentinel.json`)
persists repositories, runs, changes, endpoints, OpenAPI versions, impact, webhooks,
notifications, history, approvals, snapshots, users, sessions, and OAuth states with atomic writes. For Postgres,
implement the `store.ts` interface — engine and routes are storage-agnostic.

## Deployment

- **Docker**: `docker build -t sentinel . && docker run -p 3000:3000 sentinel`
  (standalone output, persistent `/app/data`, healthcheck on `/api/health`).
- **Render**: `render.yaml` included (web service + 1GB disk, health check,
  secret env vars). No destructive migrations run on startup.

## Testing

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test            # 44 tests: parsers, diff, risk, openapi, webhook,
                    # impact, incremental, full pipeline e2e
npm run build
```

The e2e test runs the demo FastAPI repo v1→v2 through the real pipeline and asserts:
2 changes, HIGH-risk `deviceId` request change, new `DELETE /api/users/{id}`,
impact findings, grounded AI summary, validated patch, publish, Swagger-ready spec,
history, notification, and a correct "What changed?" answer.

## Demo steps (3–5 min)

1. `/demo` → **Run the demo** (setup → baseline → push → alert → ask → patch → approve → verify).
2. Keep `/mobile` open on the phone — the alert lands live.
3. Ask by voice: *"Why is login breaking?"*
4. Review the diff + impact, approve the sync.
5. Open Swagger — synchronized docs. Ask: *"Is the API synchronized?"*

Fallbacks: demos run fully offline (fixtures + deterministic AI); with network,
connect any real GitHub repo; with a local model running, answers upgrade
transparently.

## Known limitations

- Static analysis only: dynamic route registration, decorators-as-variables, and
  heavily metaprogrammed routing may be missed (reported as unknown, never guessed).
- Webhook monitoring tracks the default branch only.
- Browser voice/notifications depend on device support (graceful fallback everywhere).
- Embedded store suits hackathon scale; swap in Postgres for multi-instance deploys.
- 512KB/file, 1200 analyzed files/repo, 120MB archive caps (all reported, never silent).

## Security

- Webhook HMAC-SHA256 verification (timing-safe), fail-closed without a secret.
- Outbound allowlist (GitHub + configured AI hosts only) — SSRF guard.
- Archive path-traversal rejection, size/file-count caps, no symlink following.
- No repository code execution, ever. Secrets redacted from logs; secret scanning
  on detection only.
- Repository content treated as untrusted data in every AI prompt.
- Input length limits, JSON size caps, ID validation on all routes.
